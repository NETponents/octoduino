    <h1>Supported Devices</h1>
    <p>The following devices are tested every build and will work with Octoduino:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Uno</li>
      <li>Mega</li>
      <li>Micro</li>
    </ul>
    <p>The following devices have special hardware on them, so we are not able to run simulations on them. They may or may not work with Octoduino.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Mega ADK</li>
      <li>Yun</li>
      <li>Leonardo</li>
    </ul>
    <p>As of the current version, Energia devices are not supported. The reason being that no usable SDFAT library exists. Hopefully this will be changed in a future version.</p>
