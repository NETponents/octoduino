It also makes use of external SWAP space, so if you decide to do something extremely complex, you aren't limited by the Arduinos small RAM space.\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\nAll documentation, along with a change log and known bugs list, is located in the `~/docs` directory and on the GitHub Wiki. All items on the Github wiki reflect the latest source on the master branch, not the latest release.\r\n\r\n## What do I need?\r\nWant to get started using Octoduino? Here's what you need to get started.\r\n- [ ] A supported Arduino board (see documentation for full list)\r\n- [ ] An ethernet + SD card shield (or a compatible custom circuit using breakout board)\r\n- [ ] SD/microSD card (depends on your shield) any size up to 4 GB\r\n\r\nNext, you'll need to grab a copy of our code from GitHub:\r\n\r\n     git clone http://github.com/NETponents/octoduino.git\r\n \r\n## Building\r\n\r\n***As of version 0.1.4, the Arduino IDE cannot be used to build Octoduino***. Instead, you have two options. You may either download and flash the pre-compiled *.hex* files, or you can build the project using PlatformIO. If you are on a Windows computer, we reccommend using the *.hex* file option (see the docs).\r\n\r\nIf you are on a Linux or Mac OS X computer and have PlatformIO installed, edit `~/build` to match your destination board and upload port, then run it.\r\n\r\nIf you need help, see the documentation or talk to us on our Gitter channel.\r\n\r\n## Setting up\r\n\r\nFollow these instructions once you flash over the Octoduino bootloader in the step above.\r\n\r\nNow take your SD/microSD card and format it to FAT32. Then copy everything ***IN*** the *~/boot* folder to the card. Now you may add your own code files in the root of the SD card (see the documentation on how to name your files). Due to a limitation of the SDFAT library, your file names must conform to the 8.3 standard. This means that the name of the file may only be 8 characters long, and the extension may only be 3 characters long.\r\n\r\nLastly, create a file at the root of the card called *lang.oct* and inside of it, put `pb`. This tells Octoduino to use the ParseBasic interpreter (the only one available right now).\r\n\r\nNow you get to run your program. Insert your SD card into your shield, then attach it to your Arduino. Make sure you have a serial console open and it is set to your Arduinos COM/tty port. Apply power and you should see your program execute. If you hit a bug, be sure to file an issue on GitHub with your system details.\r\n\r\n## Do you support non-Arduino products?\r\nEnergia is a popular tool used to deploy Arduino code on a vast array of devices. Energia devices are not supported at this time. The reason being that no usable SDFAT library exists for non-Arduino devices. In addition, the Octoduino bootloader is too big to fit on any MSP430 devices, so we decided to not support any Energia devices for now, however we may look at it in the future.\r\n\r\n## Contributing\r\nI welcome contributions of all kinds. Octoduino is developed by an unpaid high school student and the community. If you know C++, please consider making a code contribution. Please review the guidelines in **~/CONTRIBUTING.md** before starting. Otherwise, I accept donations through Gratipay (badge is at top of README.md).\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
