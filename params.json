It also makes use of external SWAP space, so if you decide to do something extremely complex, you aren't limited by the Arduinos small RAM space.\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\nAll documentation, along with a change log and known bugs list, is located in the `~/docs` directory and on the GitHub Wiki. All items on the Github wiki reflect the latest source on the master branch, not the latest release.\r\n\r\n## Getting started\r\nWant to get started using Octoduino? Here's what you need to get started.\r\n- [ ] A supported Arduino board (see documentation for full list)\r\n- [ ] An ethernet + SD card shield (or a compatible custom circuit using breakout board)\r\n- [ ] SD/microSD card (depends on your shield) any size up to 4 GB\r\n\r\nWe assume that you know how to flash programs onto your Arduino. If you are new, check out https://www.arduino.cc/en/Guide/Windows#toc9. Out of the box, the official Arduino IDE is supported. If you wish to use PlatformIO, there is a bit of tinkering involved. Check out the documentation or the wiki on GitHub for step-by-step instructions.\r\n \r\nEnergia devices are not supported at this time. The reason being that no usable SDFAT library exists. In addition, the Octoduino bootloader is too big to fit on any MSP430 devices, so we decided to not support any Energia devices for now, however we may look at it in the future.\r\n\r\nThe official size requirements (percentages are for the Arduino Uno):\r\n\r\n    AVR Memory Usage\r\n    ----------------\r\n    Device: atmega328p\r\n    \r\n    Program:   21386 bytes (65.3% Full)\r\n    (.text + .data + .bootloader)\r\n\r\n    Data:       1609 bytes (78.6% Full)\r\n    (.data + .bss + .noinit)\r\n\r\nNext, you'll need to grab a copy of our code from GitHub:\r\n\r\n     git clone http://github.com/NETponents/octoduino.git\r\n\r\nOpen *~/src/main.ino*. Go ahead and deploy it to your Arduino. If you encounter build errors, please report it in the GitHub issue tracker. If you recieve a deploy error, your device may be broken or not supported.\r\n\r\nNow take your SD/microSD card and format it to FAT32. Then copy everything ***IN*** the *~/boot* folder to the card. Now you may add your own code files in the root of the SD card (see the documentation on how to name your files). Due to a limitation of the SDFAT library, your file names must conform to the 8.3 standard. This means that the name of the file may only be 8 characters long, and the extension may only be 3 characters long.\r\n\r\nLastly, create a file at the root of the card called *lang.oct* and inside of it, put `pb`. This tells Octoduino to use the ParseBasic interpreter (the only one available right now).\r\n\r\nNow you get to run your program. Insert your SD card into your shield, then attach it to your Arduino. Make sure you have a serial console open and it is set to your Arduinos COM/tty port. Apply power and you should see your program execute. If you hit a bug, be sure to file an issue on GitHub with your system details.\r\n\r\n## Contributing\r\nI welcome contributions of all kinds. Octoduino is developed by an unpaid high school student and the community. If you know C++, please consider making a code contribution. Please review the guidelines in **~/CONTRIBUTING.md** before starting. Otherwise, I accept donations through Gratipay (badge is at top of README.md).\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
